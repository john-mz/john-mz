## Hi 👋, I’m John Stiven

I’m a Software Engineering student from Colombia, passionate about building full-stack applications and turning ideas into reality.

### 👨‍💻 What I Do

- I design and build full-stack applications that solve real problems — from small utilities to full-blown web apps.  
- **Main tech stack:** Angular, PHP, MySQL, Tailwind CSS  
- **Favorite tools:** Docker, Git, DrawIO  
- I recently started working with **n8n**, building automation workflows and custom integrations.
- I’m also diving into **DevOps practices** to improve deployment processes, scalability, and reliability of my projects.

### ⚒️ Highlighted Projects

- **AcademyConnect** — a platform that helps people find sports academies (boxing, BJJ, taekwondo, etc.) by city.  
- **Cafe-Stock** — a PHP + MySQL inventory management system for small businesses.  
- **Telegram Transcription Bot (n8n)** — a bot that receives a command and a video from a user, transcribes it, and returns an automatic summary using an n8n workflow.  

### 🎯 My Philosophy

- If an idea pops into my head, I’ll probably build it and ship it.  
- I believe in learning by doing and rapidly iterating.  
- I value clean code, modular architecture, and good documentation.

### 📚 What I’m Learning

- DevOps and deployment automation (Docker, CI/CD).  
- Better software architecture practices.  
- Workflow automation and integrations using **n8n**.

### 🎉 Fun Facts & Hobbies

- I’m very excited for the early release of **Hytale**!  
- **Hobbies:** automation, calisthenics, building things.  
- I enjoy mixing creative and technical work — coding, designing, improving workflows, etc.

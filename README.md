I'm John, a Software Engineer based on Colombia.

I build full stack applications.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Angular, Tailwind, Php and mysql. My favorite tools are drawio, docker and git.

I'm currently learning DevOps to improve the reliability of my projects.

**Fun Facts:**
- I'm excited for the early release of Hytale
- **Hobbies:** automation, calisthenics, building things
